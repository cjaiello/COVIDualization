# COVIDualization
*Christina Aiello, 2020, protected under MIT License.*

PHP + JavaScript plugin for WordPress to create a d3 United States state visualization for provided data related to how businesses were being affected by COVID. Reads from a WordPress database, and links state-by-state business data to the states in the visualization.

Created hackathon-style, 30 days spread over five days, with the final two days containing 24hrs of work total. The script was then handed off to other developers to fully flesh-out. I was just providing a starting point for them.
